Progress Steps
A clean, interactive progress tracker built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Features
Visual step-by-step progress indicator with 4 circular steps
Dynamic progress bar that fills as you advance
Next and Previous buttons to navigate through steps
Active step is highlighted for visual clarity
Buttons disable automatically at the start and end of the sequence

How It Works
Each circle represents a step in the progress bar.
The Next button moves to the next step, highlighting the circle and expanding the fill bar.
The Previous button moves back one step, shrinking the fill bar accordingly.
The progress bar and circles respond with smooth transitions.

Technologies Used
HTML5 for structure
CSS3 for layout and animations
Vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation and interactivity
